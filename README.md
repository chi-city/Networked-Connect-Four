# Networked-Connect-Four

This project implements the classic game of Connect Four.

Implementation is a two player game where each player is a separate client and the
game is run by a server. Your server and clients will use the same machine, with the
server choosing a port on the local host and clients knowing the local host and port
number. At the end of each game, each client will be able to play again or quit.
